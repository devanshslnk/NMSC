<b>Disappearing mobile numbers</b> that disappears after some time of your convenience. 
But why would that be useful right? 
        Imagine you are going for a meetup by XYZ classes and they ask for your phone number. You and they as well know that this will be used for a lot of advertising and spam via calls and sms. So to protect you from such spammers you can use these disappearing numbers valid for 1 to 5 days. 
        
## Definitions
The use case has an advertiser and a customer. 
1. <em>Advertiser</em> : The person who the number is to be given and is probably the point of contact customer do not wish to have after a particular days.
2. <em>Customer</em> : The person who wishes to issue a temporary number.

## How ?

1. The customer can issue a disappearing number for some time and submit it to advertisers with an <em>OTP</em> getting generated on our platform. 
2. The advertiser can contact you within a limited period of time with your 'disumber' and the OTP generated. <em>If you find the advertisement relevant you can contact them to exchange your real number.</em>
3. But if you don't <em>after the specified days the advertiser cannot contact you using the old line</em> and that's where the magic happened.

  This platform can be used
  1. Anywhere where there is a privacy issue and you do not wish to disclose your original number until you gain more confidence.
  2. Protection against fake and harrassing calls can be avoided
